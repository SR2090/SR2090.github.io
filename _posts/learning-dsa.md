## Learning Tips

The following has been curated from various places on the web.

1. Do not waste time learning different language. For any language learn the loops, functions and OOPS.
2. Do not waste time on a particular data structure. Depth and Breadth both are necessary. On average 15 - 25 problems.
3. Do not rush solving problem. Quality triumphs quantity.
   1. Think about the different approaches using your existing techniques, spend good amount of time. If you are still unable to continue then view the solution, then come back later for revision.
   2. Understanding approach is important. Converting that logic into code will develop through practice.
   3. Coming up with logic can only happen if you train it. Copying solution will not get you anywhere.
4. Look at other solution. Understand different approach to solving.
5. DSA is like bodybuilding you have to be consistent otherwise all your hardwork goes down the drain.
6. Stick to one particular resource and do it completely.
